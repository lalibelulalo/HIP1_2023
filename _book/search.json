El origen de HIP1 y su función (si es que tiene alguna) permanecen desconocidos. Se ha observado que el sitio de reconocimiento (5’-Gm6ATC-3 ‘) de la enzima Dam metiltransferasa específica para adenina N6 de clase D12 (Dam-met) y el sitio de reconocimiento de DmtC (5’-m5CGATCG-3 ’) están contenidos en HIP1, lo que sugiere una posible relación. Sin embargo, la asociación funcional de otros genes con HIP1 se ha reportado.","code":""},{"path":"introducción.html","id":"introducción","chapter":"1 Introducción","heading":"1 Introducción","text":"","code":""},{"path":"materials-and-methods.html","id":"materials-and-methods","chapter":"2 Materials and methods","heading":"2 Materials and methods","text":"","code":""},{"path":"materials-and-methods.html","id":"case-of-interest","chapter":"2 Materials and methods","heading":"2.1 Case of interest","text":"analysis focuses Calothrix subclade, composed 6 species. importance clade lies fact subclade species Calothrix sp. 336/3, Calothrix sp.
